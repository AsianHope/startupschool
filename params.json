This isn't just a 'make your own web page', but a deep look at the technologies behind today's successful tech businesses.\r\n\r\nWe'll be looking at things like:\r\n* HTML/CSS/JS\r\n* Frameworks (emphasizing AngularJS)\r\n* Building a single page application (SPA)\r\n* Working with a REST API\r\n* Virtual Machines, IAAS, Unix/Linux command line, text editors\r\n* Version control with git\r\n\r\nIf none of that makes any sense, that's okay! We'll cover it all and more. Beginners are encouraged! After learning the fundamental languages of the Web, students will be coached in developing a single page web app. Along the way we'll watch interviews, look at case studies of current tech companies and maybe get a chance to visit some entrepreneurs living and working in Phnom Penh.\r\n\r\n_Logos High School Students with exceptional final products and demonstrable learning may receive IT credit for this course.

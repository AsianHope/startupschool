      </h1>
      <p>Want to get involved with Summer Startup School? We have two opportunities!</p>
      <a name="casestudy"></a>
      <h2>Be a case study</h2>
      <p>
        Are you an entrepreneur? Do you work at a startup? We'd love to hear from you. 
        During the two weeks of the program students will be doing case studies on different companies.
        We'd love to arrange a video call where students (after researching your company) can ask
        questions and hear first-hand what it's like to operate in our field.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're based in Phnom Penh, Cambodia: even better! We'd love to have you over to chat.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're interested in being a case study and are willing to donate an hour of your time,
        please get in contact with the instructor, Lyle Kozloff, at lyle[at]asianhope.org

      <h2>Contribute to our hackathon</h2>
      <p>At the end of the two weeks our students will be invited to participate in a 24 hour hackathon.
      The format will be similar to <a herf="http://startupweekend.org/about/">Startup Weekend</a> but
      more limited in scope.</p>
      <p>Students will present business ideas, form teams and develop a business model and working
      prototype.</p>
      <p>You can contribute in one of two ways:
        <ul>
            <li>Sponsor an hour</li>
            <li>Be a mentor</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <a name="hour"></a>
      <h3>Sponsoring an hour</h3>
      <p>Sponsoring an hour means contributing to the sense of wonder that a hackathon should have.
      It's up to you how much excitement you want to contribute. It could be something small, like a case
      of drinks ($9). Or it could be something huge like a surprise mariachi band and catered taco bar
      (>$500). In between is okay too! We'll be happy to work with you in figuring out a good balance 
      between budget and awesomeness.</p>
       <p>Donations will be come through Asian Hope, the parent organization of Logos International. 
        As Asian Hope is a registered non-profit [501(c)3] US residents and businesses may be eligible for
        a tax rebate. Please ask a tax professional or Certified Public Accountant for specific questions
        on your eligibility.</p>

      <p>Sponsoring an hour can be done through the <a href="https://www.asianhope.org/give-online">donation page on Asian Hope's website.</a>
      <p><em>Any donations in excess of the hackathon's budget will be directed towards the greatest
          need at Asian Hope</em></p>
      <a name="mentor"></a>
     <h3>Mentoring</h3>
      <p>If you're a business owner or software professional, we'd love to have you come by and
      help our students make progress. You can come as long or as little as you'd like. We'd love to 
      have mentors to help out with:
      <ul>
          <li>Developing a business plan</li>
          <li>Front end or logo design</li>
          <li>Coding (HTML/CSS/JS)</li>
    </ul>
        If you're not based in Phnom Penh, that's completely okay. US ane Europe based mentors will be
        extremely helpful, as you'll be able to provide guidance in the late night/early morning without
        having to stay up late!
    </p>
    <p>If you're interested in being a mentor, please get in contact with the instructor, Lyle Kozloff, at lyle[at]asianhope.org</p>
